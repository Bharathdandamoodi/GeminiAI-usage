# GeminiAI Usage

## Overview

The **GeminiAI-usage** repository demonstrates how to use the GeminiAI API for creating a chatbot that mimics functionalities similar to the GeminiIA platform. The project is built to integrate the Gemini API and showcases how to implement chatbot features using different programming techniques.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following components:
- **API Integration**: Code for connecting to the GeminiAI API and making requests.
- **Chatbot Logic**: Business logic for handling user queries and responses.
- **Examples**: Sample usage scenarios to showcase how the chatbot interacts with users.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
- A valid GeminiAI API key (if required)
- Development environment with Java (or another relevant programming language) set up
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone Bharathdandamoodi/GeminiAI-usage
   cd GeminiAI-usage
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Make sure you have the required dependencies installed for the project. If using Java, ensure the appropriate libraries for HTTP requests and JSON handling (like `Gson` or `Jackson`) are included.

3. **Configuration**
   - Update the API configuration file (if applicable) with your GeminiAI API key and other settings.

4. **Run the Project**
   - Use your preferred IDE or command line to run the project. For example, if using Java:
     ```bash
     javac ChatbotMain.java
     java ChatbotMain
     ```

## Example Usage

1. **Sending a Chat Query**
   - Once the chatbot is running, you can send a query to the bot.
   - The chatbot will process the input, interact with the GeminiAI API, and return a response.

2. **Sample Input/Output**
   - **Input**: "Hello, what can you do?"
   - **Output**: "Hi! I can assist you with various tasks, including answering questions and providing information. What would you like to know?"

## Features

- **Integration with GeminiAI API**: Makes it easy to connect to the GeminiAI services and perform various operations.
- **Dynamic Chatbot Responses**: Implements a flexible response mechanism to handle different types of user queries.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows you to modify API settings, response formats, and other configurations to fit your use case.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more complex conversation flows
- Integrating with additional external services for enhanced functionalities
- Improving error handling and API response processing
